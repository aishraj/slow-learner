Slow Learner
==============

** This repository is a work in progress and a _learning experiment_ **

It contains the sample code and a collection of first few programs which I wrote while I learnt Python and subsequently Mongodb using pymongo.

This is not how I exaclty code, and the code is a mere example of personal learning. While I wrote the solutions to the problems, being a C/C++ person, I might have given done some really silly code. Aplologies for that. :)

The code contains practice stuff  from [Google's Python Class] (http://code.google.com/edu/languages/google-python-class/) and [Python Challenge] (http://www.pythonchallenge.com/)  and [10gen's Mongodb class] (http://education.10gen.com/).
